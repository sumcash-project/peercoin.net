      "howOldQuestion": "How old is the Sumcash project?",
      "howOldAnswer": "Sumcash's chain started on August 19th, 2019 at 18:00:00 UTC. There was no premine and the launch of the project was announced nine days before it went live. You can read the original announcement thread here: <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=101820.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcointalk</a>",
      "howCanIMineQuestion": "How can I mine Sumcash?",
      "howCanIMineAnswer": "Sumcash uses the SHA256 cryptographic hash function. Any hardware that can effectively mine Bitcoin can be used to mine Sumcash.",
      "whyMintingQuestion": "Why a 1% minting return on staking? Why isn't there a hard limit on the total number of SUMC? Doesn't this disqualify Sumcash as a deflationary currency?",
      "whyMintingAnswer": "Sumcash has a 1% inflation rate to allow for participant determined growth over time. Fully deflationary currencies cannot be used as mediums of exchange, but rather solely stores of value. By allowing for a manageable inflation rate, Sumcash remains scarce while allowing for growth determined by participation. This also helps offset coins that are removed from circulation through lost wallets or malevolent destruction.",
      "whyFixedFeeQuestion": "Why a fixed transaction fee?",
      "whyFixedFeeAnswer": "Sumcash has a fixed transaction fee that filters out the kind of spam transactions that have damaged chains like Bitcoin. A fixed fee also allows for predictable sending fees, which may become unpredictable on chains where fees can rapidly change, leaving transactions in limbo for several days. This allows for first come, first served transactions as well. Sumcash is able to scale without worrying about valuation effecting usability. In version 0.7, the transaction fee is being lowered from 0.01 Sumcash to 0.001 Sumcash.",
      "howCanSumcashQuestion": "How can the Sumcash network survive without miners providing PoW security, especially during times of low interest?",
      "howCanSumcashAnswer": "Proof-of-work serves as an inflationary mechanism to distribute coins. The Sumcash network is secured by coin age and proof-of-stake. With pure proof-of-work chains, holders have little ability to secure the chain with the high cost of mining equipment acing as a barrier to entry. Any Sumcash holder can protect their investment by allowing a transaction to mature and leaving their wallet open. Proof-of-stake minting has kept the network secure since Sumcash's inception.",
      "whyNoMintingQuestion": "I just moved SUMC to my wallet and it says I have a zero percent chance of minting in the next 30 days. Why is that?",
      "whyNoMintingAnswer": "Sumcash transactions must mature 30 days or roughly 4320 blocks before they can become eligible for minting. This number is updated roughly every six hours. Once the 30 day period passes, your coins will become eligible and the minting probability should adjust accordingly.",
      "howManyConfirmationsQuestion": "How many confirmations are required on the Sumcash network for a transaction?",
      "howManyConfirmationsAnswer": "Six confirmations are required for a transaction to be verified. Each block takes about 1 minute.",
      "whyNotAvailableMintinQuestion": "I just minted some coins but it says they are unavailable at the moment. Why is that?",
      "whyNotAvailableMintinAnswer": "Once a transaction mints, it takes 520 confirmations before these coins become unlocked. This is done to prevent spoofed minting. Each block on the Sumcash network takes about 1 minute, so it takes 5,200 minutes or around 3.6 days for the minted coins to become available."

    "peerAssetsP2": "PeerAsset protocol based assets can be utilized to represent any type of asset like bonds or equity. PeerAssets can also represent real life objects, and by doing so confirm their existence on the blockchain. PeerAssets is a light protocol, as it utilizes no extra layers over the underlying blockchain. It does not require external value tokens beside the blockchain's native currency, which is used to pay transaction fees. PeerAssets does not participate in organizing nor maintaining of the public ledger, but takes advantage of its stability and trustworthiness. PeerAssets can work on top of every cryptocurrency that is forked from Bitcoin and has kept a compatible codebase, which includes Sumcash, Litecoin and alike.",
    "peerAssetsP3": "PeerAssets requires no hard nor soft fork of the host network, but it requires development of a PeerAssets aware client. PeerAssets is also inspired by the original idea of \"Colored Coins\" and uses OP_RETURN to write data on the blockchain, but offers some optimizations to reduce the amount of data written in OP_RETURN. PeerAssets enables easy querying of the blockchain for relevant transactions and offers some extra features like shareholder voting and dividend payouts.",

    "perperaP2": "The main purpose of this protocol is the embedding of arbitrary documents into the blockchain (proof-of-existence) and the ability to revise said documents. In this aspect (support for revisions), this protocol is different than similar protocols which are already in use.",
    "perperaP3": "More on the PeerAssets DataAudit protocol:",
    "perperaP4": "The primary purpose of this protocol is to record cryptographic hashes of successive revisions of single-file documents in a public blockchain, in a manner which enables thin clients to easily query and verify document histories. Such histories inherit useful properties from the underlying blockchain, namely immutability and massive replication, and can therefore serve as proofs of existence. In addition to cryptographic hashes, users may also record a collection of URLs for each document, facilitating retrieval of document contents from off-chain sources (IPFS, https, torrent). The goal is to impose minimal requirements on the blockchain, in terms of both features and storage space.",

    "efficientEnergyText3": "Due to the cost efficient nature of proof-of-stake’s time based consensus rules, Sumcash is capable of allowing any network connected computer to participate in the blockchain’s security process. This efficiency strengthens Sumcash by growing the number of security providers and ensuring that security can be sustained over the long-term.",
    "userGovernanceTitle": "User Governance",
    "userGovernanceText1": "In Sumcash, coin owners (stakeholders) are the ones who wield influence over the network, produce new blocks, and secure the chain. Stakeholders of Sumcash co-own the blockchain and collectively decide its future through protocol voting.",
    "userGovernanceText2": "Voting is carried out the same way Sumcash is secured, through a process called proof-of-stake minting. Stakeholders participate in minting simply by installing the version of Sumcash they support, loading their wallet with SUMC, and holding them while they are occasionally selected by Sumcash’s protocol to mint the next block in the chain. Every minted block rewards stakeholders with new SUMC and a vote.",
    "userGovernanceText3": "This makes Sumcash the first blockchain capable of allowing its protocol rules to be governed directly by its users, making for a network that is more decentralized, democratic, and easily secured by people around the world.",
    "trustlessTitle": "Trustless Base Layer",
    "trustlessText1": "Given that the blockchain is immutable by its very nature and all recorded data is stored forever, chain bloat becomes an escalating problem at higher usage levels which harms both security and the ability of the network to scale.",
    "trustlessText2": "To preserve the trustless security of the blockchain and ensure its ability to scale to global usage levels, Sumcash’s inventors tailored the blockchain and its economics to fulfill the specific role of base layer settlement network.",
    "trustlessText3": "This role focuses Sumcash development on modularity, keeping the protocol simple and secure with as few features as possible, while maintaining the blockchain as a stable base upon which any number of additional layers can be built on top.",
    "fairDistributionTitle": "Fair Distribution",
    "fairDistributionText1": "Cryptocurrencies must have a distribution wide enough to ensure that the overall coin supply does not get concentrated into the hands of too few people.",
    "fairDistributionText2": "However a problem exists for blockchains that are run purely on Proof-of-Stake, as there is no easy way to fairly distribute the initial coin supply. In a pure Proof-of-Stake blockchain network, the entire coin supply is usually created by the project founder, who then chooses which individuals get to own stake. This distribution method often ends in a network with a highly centralized coin supply.",
    "fairDistributionText3": "To solve this problem, Sumcash uses Proof-of-Stake for network security and Proof-of-Work for distribution. Proof-of-Work miners are rewarded with new SUMC generated by the network. This newly mined SUMC is then sold on exchanges by miners for profit and purchased by new stakeholders who can use it to mint blocks by participating in Proof-of-Stake consensus.",
    "fairDistributionText4": "So while Proof-of-Stake provides security directly, Proof-of-Work is designed to do so indirectly by strengthening the decentralization of the network through a wider distribution of SUMC to new potential minters.",
    "valueStoreTitle": "Reliable Value Store",
    "valueStoreText1": "Efficiency, sustainability, user governance, scalability through modularity, and a fair distribution. All these qualities combine to form a long-term minded blockchain network that is primarily focused on maximizing decentralization.",
    "valueStoreText2": "This primary focus works to preserve the trustless, immutable and censorship resistant nature of Sumcash so that it can always be relied upon to fulfill its core role as a distributed mechanism for securely storing all types of value.",
    "valueStoreText3": "This value can be anything from fiat wealth being stored in SUMC, to data being stored on the chain in the form of tokens, records, or contracts. Regardless of the type of value that is being stored, Sumcash was built with the fundamentals in mind to always ensure that your data remains safe and secure.",
